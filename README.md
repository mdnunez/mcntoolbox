# mcntoolbox
The Mathematical Cognitive Neuroscience Toolbox (mcntoolbox).

The current purpose of the mcntoolbox is to provide users interested in cognitive neuroscience and mathematical psychology a set of example scripts for data analysis and experimentation.

Currently, most of the example scripts will be written in MATLAB. However R code is also included and Python code will be included in the future.

As mcntoolbox evolves over time, its purpose may change.
